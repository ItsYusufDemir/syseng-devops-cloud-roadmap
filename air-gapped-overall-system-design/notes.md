# Info
- in this section, I will design secure, optimized, HA air-gapped systems in overoll.

# Notes

- We simulate air-gapped system here via CDR and DLP transfer simulators.

## Nexus

- Nexus in air-gapped system.

- There is a repo hosted type named air-gapped-pypi. When user enters pip install x, request sent to the smart_proxy script. It checks first nexus, if nexus does not have, creates a request to the high_side_in. Then dlp transfer it to the low_side_out. Then low side agent watches the directory and when it sees new request, it downloads the python package to the low_side_in. Then cdr transfers it to the high_side_out. Lastly, high_side_uploader watches that file and uploads it to the nexus.
- if the user try again, she can now able to download it via nexus.
